## How to Start the Game

To start playing Contra, follow these simple steps:

If you would rather run directly from the source (or want to develop the game), make sure to have Python installed and run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` in the repository folder.

Then you can run python `main.py` or "./main.py" (only for Python 3) in linux operating system to start the game. If you ever need to remove a module for any reason, use the command `pip uninstall (module-name)`

## Instructions

In Contra, your mission is to navigate through the level, defeating enemies and avoiding obstacles along the way. Use your arrow keys to move the player character and press the spacebar to fire bullets at enemies. Keep an eye on your health bar – take too much damage, and it's game over!
